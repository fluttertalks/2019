### first step
 * add a cactus sprite and render it (you can use SpriteComponent)

 * add a random generator for new cacti

### middle step
 * add scoring and death
 * add title menu and end game card
 * add pterodactyls, night mode or something else (be creative!)

### final step
 * create an play store listing and publish
 * add play_games integration (login, achievements, saving score, leadderboards)
 * add an IAP for donations :)
